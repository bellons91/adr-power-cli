## About Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADR is a formal document that helps you track the most important architectural decisions.

It's main focus is **not just** on the final decision. It's all about tracking also the reasons behind your choices. Only by understanding the current context and the reason of a choice you can decide if a decision was wrong, and you should modify your architecture.
